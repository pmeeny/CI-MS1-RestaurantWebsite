![Responsive site example](/assets/images/responsive_devices.png)

# UX
## Strategy
### Primary Goal
- The primary goal of the website from the site owners perspective is to increase bookings and visibility of the restaurant to potential customers
- The primary goal of the website from a site users perspective is to find out details about the restaurant, view the menu and book a table online.
## Structure
I have structured the website into four pages, each with clear, concise structure, information and purpose. I use the Bootstrap grid system throughout, which gave a consistent structure and responsive design "out of the box"

1. Index: The index(homepage): This is the first page the user encounters, it contains a header/footer and imagery/links to the other pages Menu, About Us, Awards as well as a button to book a table in the restaurant
2. Menu: The menu page displays the restaurant menu and a picture carousel
3. Awards: The awards page displays awards from 2017-2020 and a Youtube video
4. About Us: The about us page displays the three team members, picture and biography

## Surface
### Color Palette
There are five colours in the color palette with a 
- Primary colour of #0F4C75(Dark Blue/Navy) 
- Secondary colour of #6B4E0A (Gold)
- Grey colour of #E8E8E8
- White colour of #FFFFFF 
- Black colour of #212529
![Responsive site example](/assets/images/color_palette.png)

- I feel the primary and secondary colours complement each other very well, and I choose those colours after testing a number of palettes while making sure the colour palette met accessibility standards.

### Typography
The Lato font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the Lato font cannot be imported into the website correctly.

##  Features Left to Implement
The following features are outside the scope of this milestone project, but they would provide the user with a moe complete user experience from the site, and would also drive users to the website.
- An online table booking feature that has a server side implementation and database to store bookings
- An online ordering feature, so that users can order online, this would require a server side implementation, database and payment processing to process orders
- Google maps integration - In an earlier version of the website I had used the Google Maps API to add a google map to the footer. The performance of the index page in the Google Developer lighthouse analysis tool was less than 70% on a mobile device so I decided to remove the api integration and to just use a map image linked to google maps. I also investigated the Google static maps api, but there is a charge to use this API, from what I can see, even for home projects. At the time I also looked into lazy loading of images and files in a browser to improve mobile performance, hence why I am using the lazy loading javascript code (https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes).

## Bugs found during the testing phase

Bug Number | Comment |  Solution/Design decision |
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | 
1 | When the website was deployed to GitPages some images were not displaying | The fix was to update the image src to remove the "/" from ```src="/assets/images/name ofimage...``` to ```src="assets/images/name ofimage...```
2 | The table booking modal was not loading on phone and tablet devices | The fix was to make sure only the button div was under the div ```<div class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block">``` rather than the button and the modal
3 | The carousel on its own container div looked out of place and too large | The fix was to put the menu and the carousel side by side in a row div
4 | The book a table button looked out of place under the burger menu on tablet and mobile devices | The fix was to hide the button in the navigation bar on mobile and tablet devices using the following classes ```<div class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block">```
5 | The wave accessibility analysis tool displayed an error of the contrast of the original gold (#AF83460 and white text on the buttons on the website |The fix was to use a different colour for the secondary colour #6B4E0A
6 | The google lighthouse tool displayed poor index.html performance on a mobile with regards image loading |The fix was to use a lazy loading javascript: https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes
7 | The 4 images on the index looks squashed using a standard container class | The fix was to use the container-fluid, so that more of the space was used ```<div class="container-fluid four-images-and-text">```
8 | The date picker ```<input type="datetime-local">``` was not displaying on Mozilla firefox(version 85.0) | The fix was to use ```<input type="date">``` and ```<input type="date">``` which is supported in Mozilla firefox(version 85.0)

# Deployment
The website was developed using initially the Gitpod IDE, but then I switched to use the Visual Studio Code IDE due to the extensibility of the Visual Studio Code IDE and I plan on using this IDE for future projects. 

The source code is stored in GIT in the repo: pmeeny/CodeInstitute-MilestoneProject1-RestaurantWebsite(master branch) 

The website was deployed on GitHub pages (https://pages.github.com/) using the following steps
1. Log to GitHub (https://wwww.github.com)
2. Click the Repositories tab and select the repository pmeeny/CodeInstitute-MilestoneProject1-RestaurantWebsite 
3. In the menu, select Settings
4. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
5. Under source, select the master branch and save
6. The website is now deployed, and the link is displayed in the GitHub Pages section

To run this project locally, you will need to clone the repository
1. Login to GitHub (https://wwww.github.com)
2. Select the repository pmeeny/CodeInstitute-MilestoneProject1-RestaurantWebsite 
3. Click the Code button and copy the HTTPS url, for example: https://github.com/pmeeny/CodeInstitute-MilestoneProject1-RestaurantWebsite.git
4. In your IDE, open a terminal and run the git clone command, for example 

```git clone https://github.com/pmeeny/CodeInstitute-MilestoneProject1-RestaurantWebsite.git```

5. The repository will now be cloned in your workspace
